# Telco Customer Churn Analysis
 Customer Turnover or churn rate, is the percentage of an organization's customer base lost during a given period of time, usually a month or annual basis. It can be an indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, better marketing strategies from the competition.  The goal of this project is to predict the customer churn in a Telecommunication company. We will deploy over several classification machine learning algorithms to determine the customers' willingness to churn. We will also be exploring various factors that contribute towards the customer dissatisfaction and their willingness to churn.
